The property is currently being leased by a local to farm alfalfa and grass hay and grazing for cows. Improvements include multiple agricultural buildings with power and culinary water from a well. Water rights associated with the property include 320.736 acre-feet with underground well and 14 springs. The water right can be used to irrigate 74.5 acres and a stock watering right of 812 ELU (Equivalent Livestock Unit). There are 4 artesian wells on the property in various locations that run year round. These water sources could provide beautiful landscapes and waterways within a future development. The property is zoned agricultural and the future land use plan will allow for low-density residential.
